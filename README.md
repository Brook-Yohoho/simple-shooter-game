# Simple HTML5 Shooter Game

A basic 2D top-down shooter game created using HTML5 Canvas and plain JavaScript. No external libraries are required.

## Features

* Player ship movement (Left/Right)
* Shooting bullets (Spacebar)
* Enemies spawning randomly from the top and moving downwards
* Collision detection between bullets and enemies
* Collision detection between the player and enemies
* Score tracking
* Game over state

## How to Play

* **Move:** Use the **Left Arrow Key (←)** and **Right Arrow Key (→)** to move your ship horizontally.
* **Shoot:** Press the **Spacebar** to fire bullets upwards.
* **Objective:** Shoot down the incoming red enemy squares to score points.
* **Avoid:** Do not let the enemy squares hit your ship. If you collide with an enemy, the game is over.
* **Restart:** Reload the browser page (`F5` or `Cmd+R`/`Ctrl+R`) to play again after a game over.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Download or Clone:** Download the `index.html` file (or clone this repository).
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No web server is needed.


## Customization

Feel free to modify the source code (`index.html`) to:
* Adjust game parameters like player speed, bullet speed, enemy speed, spawn rates, etc.
* Change the appearance (colors, shapes) of the player, bullets, and enemies.
* Add sound effects for shooting, hitting enemies, or game over.
* Implement new features like power-ups, different enemy types, boss battles, or levels.
